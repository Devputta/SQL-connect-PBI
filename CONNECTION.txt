SOME DaX MEASURES

1.Total Boxes = SUM(sales[Boxes]) --> it will count the total boxes using sum function.
2.Total Amount = SUM(sales[Amount]) --> same as previse it will count the total amount using sum function.
3.Shipment Count = COUNTROWS(sales) --> this will count the entire rows of sales table for shipment count because 1 row is equal to 1 shipment.
4.Low BOX Shipment = CALCULATE([Shipment Count], sales[Boxes]<50) --> it will calculate low shipment using calculated measured shipment count and sales tables boxes which is less then 50.
5.LBS = DIVIDE([Low BOX Shipment], [Shipment Count]) --> it will calculate the ratio of low shipment count using divide function.
